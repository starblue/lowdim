> A library for two-, three- or four-dimensional coordinates and arrays.

## Applications

This is intended for discrete geometry,
both for operations with discrete coordinates and arrays accessed by these.
Operations include iterating over neighbours.
This is useful for example in

- cellular automata
- game boards
- Santa's base at the north pole [(Advent of Code)](https://adventofcode.com/).
