//! Affine geometry for discrete 2d to 4d game and puzzle worlds.
//!
//! Provides vectors, matrices, points and more to simplify
//! programming for 2d to 4d games and puzzles.
//! Features include:
//! * Bounding boxes and iterators over the points inside them
//! * Arrays indexed by points
//! * Rotations and reflections
//! * Taxicab (L1) and maximum (Lâˆž) metrics
//! * Orthogonal and king's move neighbourhoods
//!
//! This was originally motivated by
//! [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
//!
//! ## Crate Status
//!
//! Experimental
//!
//! ### Limitations
//! - Bounding boxes and arrays are only implemented for the 2d case.
//! - Rotations are only implemented for the 2d case, reflections not at all.
//!
//! ## Crate Feature Flags
//!
//! - `random`
//!   - Off by default.
//!   - Adds a dependency to the `rand` crate.
//!   - Adds the method `BBox2d::random_point` to generate random points
//!     in a bounding box.
